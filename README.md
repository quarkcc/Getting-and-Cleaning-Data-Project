# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

In this project the data is read from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

From this data I have created a tidy data set, and the code is in the script: run_analysis.R

And then final data is in the text-plan file called averages_set.txt

Also, you can see the code book in the file called CodeBook.md
